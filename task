1) Distribution of fpkm for each sample
INPUT: a sample is presented as a vector of fpkm  values
OUTPUT: distribution of fpkm values
2) PCA plot:
Input: n samples (each sample is represented as a vector of fpkm values, obtained from sailfish) and their group information
OUPUT: PCA plot. Each sample  is a point in the PCA plot. The group information is used to make the type of the point. For example, samples in group A are presented as stars, samples in group B is presented as circular points.
Or we can simply use different color for each group.
